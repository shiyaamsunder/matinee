# Matinee - Full Stack Movie Reservation Application

A personal project to showcase my skills that I have learnt so far in fullstack.

Planning this project to have intermediate to advanced topics/desings implemented. Based on the project idea in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/movie-reservation-system)

What I'm planning to do?
1. Full blown backend server that can handle movie showtime scheduling, reservations etc.,
2. Frontend + Mobile application for the users to view/purchase movie tickets etc.,
3. Proper DB maintaince by following db migrations, auditing.
4. And more (will update this list as the project gets shaped up)

What I have done so far?
1. Project Setup - Backend - Java + Postgres + Flyway (db migration)
2. Initial level of DB Schema Design.
